# Portfolio of Sebastian Schindler

Portfolio is programmed with Vite and React.

It is a single page application (SPA) that uses React Router for navigation.
The project is built with TypeScript and styled with SASS and ChakraUI.

It's hosted in future on Vercel.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

In my case I use pnpm as package manager, but you can use npm or yarn as well.

```bash
pnpm i
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the application on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Build

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the production build of the application.
